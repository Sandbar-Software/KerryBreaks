# KerryBreaks
This repositary is for holding development code for an Android app promoting short breaks near Barrow Harbour, Co Kerry.
Focussing on a single part of Co Kerry is a practical necessity since there is so much to see and do in this county that no single app - nor book - could possibly encompass it in a quickly readable manner. Barrow Harbour has been chosen as the area of interest because of its two beautiful beaches: the lagoon beach enclosed by the Carrahane sandbar and the world-famous Long Strand, used by David Lean for the opening scene of his 1970 film, "Ryan's Daughter". Barrow has also gained a golf links since 1980 when the local Tralee Golf Club moved from their previous base at Mounthawk to the seafront warren in West Barrow.
This app is principally written as a portfolio project. It will carry no advertising nor will it accept payments from businesses in return for listing their enterprises. Were it to be offered to the public a small nominal charge might be made, largely to offset the cost of distributing the app via established channels like Google Play and iTunes.
